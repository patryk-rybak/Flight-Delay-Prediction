## Flight Delay Prediction Project

In our project, our aim is to predict flight delays and, as we progress, to further refine the program to calculate the most probable delay values. Throughout our work, 
we will utilize a dataset containing flight information from 2017 and 2018, provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in conjunction with Weather API in collaboration with visualcrossing.com. The primary focus is to examine the correlation between weather conditions and flight delays. Our approach hinges on leveraging machine learning techniques, wherein we'll be employing statistical learning models using Python. 

We believe that our project can contribute to improving the travel experience by offering  more accurate information about potential flight delays.
